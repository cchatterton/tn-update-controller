# Validation — 0.1.0

Run on 26 September 2026 in an isolated local WordPress 7.1.2 installation with both controllers, PHP 8.5.7 and MySQL 8.0.35. All packaged PHP also passes PHP 8.1.29 syntax checks.

## Executed checks

- Cold, warm and failed caches: repeated native update-transient reads, View details and all six controller screens made zero update-metadata HTTP calls.
- One aggregate HTTP request per brand check; cooldown, atomic lock, independent brand state, 429 / Retry-After backoff, malformed metadata and last-good cache retention.
- Strict author/repository identity, duplicate IDs, third-party provider preservation, unauthorised install/check rejection.
- Native official release ZIP installation and old-to-current updates for Menubot and AS QS Relay; checksum and root/version verification; newly installed plugins remain inactive; update preserves activation and an existing settings option.
- Tampered package and unexpected archive root rejection; PHP/dependency requirements; disabled file modifications; partial-batch results and safe interrupted-request recovery.
- Audited legacy hooks removed for Menubot and AS QS Relay; active client/controller metadata produces one GitHub link and one controller check link.
- Absent/inactive controller bootstrap: correct Install/Activate actions, repeated helper inclusion without duplicate handlers, and zero HTTP.
- Multisite: network-scoped state and locks, main-site-only scheduling, no subsite schedule duplication, subsite-admin install denial and rejection of a merely site-active controller as a network provider.
- Both controllers updated themselves from their live published GitHub ZIPs on the disposable multisite, preserving network activation and saved controller state. Live published catalogues include the controller itself.
- Browser: desktop cards, 390-pixel layout, live catalogue search, manual-mode settings save, and independent AlphaSys catalogue.

## Reproduction

Use a disposable installation with both source repositories linked into wp-content/plugins and both controllers active. These tests intentionally change test options and install official plugin assets. Never run them on a live customer site.

```sh
wp eval-file tests/integration.php
wp eval-file tests/install.php
wp eval-file tests/security.php
# On a disposable multisite with both controllers network-active and blog ID 2:
wp eval-file tests/multisite.php
```

Tests use the adjacent repository catalogue fixtures. `install.php` requires outbound access to the public GitHub release assets. The publisher independently verifies every catalogue ZIP before publication.

## Limits

WordPress 6.5 is the declared minimum; full runtime tests used WordPress 7.1.2. PHP 8.1 was syntax-checked. Feature behaviour of all catalogue plugins, every historical legacy updater version, hosting credential-based filesystem transports, host-specific MU code and every possible feature-plugin activation scope were not exhaustively exercised. The guided installer supports direct filesystem writes; native WordPress flows remain the recovery route on credential-based filesystems. The controller is not a backup or rollback service.

Initial feature-plugin catalogue releases still use legacy integration. Their migration status is explicit. Reviewed hashes apply only to the exact inspected updater files. A future plugin release that changes those files needs migration to the client API or a new audited controller registry release. No customer site was changed during these tests.

## 0.1.1 — ten-plugin migration batch

The candidate-package test upgraded all ten selected Techn plugins through the controller's native WordPress upgrader. It covered the actual published TN User Management 1.8 package and the latest previous releases of the other nine, including QR Codes 1.5 (no published 1.4 package was found). One aggregate lookup served all ten, repeated legacy reads added zero metadata requests, each stored test setting survived, activation scope was preserved and all target headers reported Techn Controller API 1.

All ten migrated clients were also loaded together with the controller absent, installed-inactive and network-active. The shared helper registered once, each row had one GitHub and one correct controller action, and unauthorised users had no install/activate/check action. Persona26 integration, 55 Content Planner feature assertions on single-site WordPress and eight standalone WP Migrate suites passed. A native browser check showed consistent By Techn / GitHub / Check for updates links without Visit plugin site. The Environments save/redirect flow was corrected to run before admin output and verified in the browser.

The migration releases require WordPress 7.0+ and PHP 8.5+. Runtime testing used WordPress 7.1.2/PHP 8.5.7. No customer-site deployment has been performed.

The browser-driven **published** release run also completed ten of ten. It preserved network activation timestamps, site-only Menubot activation, inactive QR Codes state, and saved palette/content-plan/Persona26/environment settings. Repeated post-migration metadata reads remained HTTP-free. See [the release report](TEN-PLUGIN-MIGRATION.md).

## PHP 7.4 correction

See [PHP compatibility validation](PHP-COMPATIBILITY.md) for WordPress 7.0 runtime testing on PHP 7.4.30, 8.1.23 and 8.5.7. This supersedes the earlier PHP minimum and syntax-only compatibility notes above.

## Interface 0.2.0

See [interface validation](INTERFACE-0.2.0.md) for modal checking, bulk progress, failure and interruption recovery, catalogue installation and PHP 7.4 rendering checks.

## Manual discovery 0.6.0 — 4 October 2026

Executed in a new disposable WordPress 7.0 installation and then converted to multisite, with an isolated MySQL 8.0.35 database. No customer site changed.

- Both publishers: 12 offline tests each; live paginated discovery and published ZIP verification for both brands. New unregistered matching releases are found; cross-brand packages are excluded.
- PHP 7.4.30: syntax validation of all packaged PHP and the manual-discovery runtime suite on multisite. PHP 8.1.23: single-site integration, manual-discovery, security/recovery, beta grouping and admin UI assertions; multisite scope/lock/permission and manual-discovery suites.
- Both standalone domain-metadata suites pass, including cold caches, hostname boundaries and localhost policy.
- Native WordPress installation and old-to-current upgrade of Menubot and AS QS Relay pass with checksum verification, activation and settings preservation. Tampered downloads and wrong package roots are rejected.
- Manual regression tests verify legacy schedule removal, ignored scheduled preferences, no HTTP for cron/generic force-check/background calls, one request for both new capability discovery and installed updates, cooldown, denied users, and withdrawal cleanup.
- Existing integration tests cover rate-limit backoff, invalid metadata, last-good preservation, atomic locks, cold/warm cache reads and third-party update preservation.
- Author Branded interfaces retain existing AlphaSys/Techn styling and accessible modal labels/status markup. All three tabs render without discovery HTTP. The only settings UI change replaces scheduling controls with a fixed manual-only explanation.

Browser follow-up: after correcting the disposable site URL and replacing a stale browser tab, both Author Branded settings screens were visually checked at 1280 × 720 and 390 × 844. Version watermark, manual-only explanation and controls remain readable without overlap. Keyboard activation of Check for updates showed the labelled progress dialog, refreshed status and returned focus to the button. These checks apply the existing Branding and UX standard; no broader redesign was made.

Limitations: no full screen-reader audit or exhaustive viewport matrix was performed. Older fixture-dependent feature/action tests require a larger preinstalled plugin set and were not completed in this fresh runtime. All feature-plugin behaviour, unknown legacy updater code, credentials-based filesystem transports and production rollout remain outside this validation. New releases require explicit feed publication before a site manual check can discover them. Existing historical validation notes above describe earlier versions, including their now-removed scheduling behaviour.

Release delivery verified: both published v0.6.0 ZIPs match the committed root ZIPs byte-for-byte. Remote feeds match the generated snapshots and controller package checksums. Both controllers self-updated disposable old-version copies to 0.6.0 through the live feed and native WordPress upgrader, preserving network activation and stored state. The final feeds contain 17 AlphaSys and 22 Techn entries; IA GPT is newly discovered relative to the previous Techn feed.
