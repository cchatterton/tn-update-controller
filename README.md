# TN Update Controller

A WordPress plugin library and update coordinator for **Techn-authored plugins from cchatterton on GitHub**. Installable ZIP: [latest release](https://github.com/cchatterton/tn-update-controller/releases/latest/download/tn-update-controller.zip).

WordPress 6.5+, PHP 7.4+ with the ZIP extension. On multisite, network activate it. Open **Plugins → Techn Plugins** (Network Admin on multisite).

- **Installed:** version comparisons, update-management status, per-plugin checks and selected bulk updates.
- **Catalogue:** searchable cards, release notes, install/update/activate actions. Installation leaves new feature plugins inactive.
- **Settings:** explains fixed manual-only checks. **Check for updates** refreshes available plugins and installed update status together.

Activation removes obsolete controller schedules. It performs no discovery or plugin upgrades. Review updates and choose **Update selected plugins**. Each update has a separate result and an interrupted batch can be resumed. The controller updates itself last. Existing activation and settings are preserved by native WordPress installation APIs. Keep your normal backup and staging process; a batch is not an atomic transaction or a site rollback service.

## Ownership and coexistence

Public stable releases from cchatterton with verified Techn package authorship are discovered by default, regardless of repository prefix. Ordinary new plugins need no registry entry. The registry holds reviewed exceptions: ambiguous authors, explicit includes/excludes, domain restrictions, aliases/supersession, legacy compatibility and readiness overrides. Check for updates builds the local catalogue directly from verified GitHub releases. See [discovery and exceptions](docs/DISCOVERY.md). Both controllers retain separate brand identities, namespaces and locks.

## Performance

Page rendering, update transient filters, notices and plugin details read local state only. Check for updates first checks known plugin versions using GitHub's canonical public stable-release redirect, without a REST API request per plugin. Unchanged verified versions need no ZIP download. Only a changed version is downloaded and verified. Released tags/assets must remain immutable; publish a new version for new bytes.

Verified identities and versions are stored durably in WordPress site options. Learned other-author/non-plugin repositories are also stored there and skipped for 24 hours; changing an exception invalidates its ignore record. A lightweight paginated API listing still discovers new repositories on a normal check. Settings → Recheck all repositories revisits ignored entries and audits release asset metadata through the API. It is intentionally slower.

Routine warm checks use one API listing request per 100 repositories, plus a lightweight public version request per known plugin. Up to five transitions share a browser request, with a two-second dispatch budget checked between operations. Each HTTP lookup is bounded to eight seconds; changed ZIP inspections have a 25-second budget and 64 MiB compressed/256 MiB expanded/10,000-file limits. PHP ZipArchive is required. Closing the page stops further steps; another explicit check resumes. Successful checks have a 60-second cooldown.

API throttling can defer discovery of new repositories, but it no longer prevents checking known plugins or their new versions. Public GitHub release lookups can also fail or throttle; those retain the previous result and honour their retry timing. No transport is unconditionally unlimited. Optional `TNUC_GITHUB_TOKEN` in wp-config.php supports public API discovery/audits; never commit credentials. No site inventory is sent.

No controller cron, background polling or automatic checker runs. Upgrade migration clears old controller schedules and ignores saved scheduled-mode preferences. Generic WordPress force-check query parameters cannot initiate discovery. Native WordPress auto-update preferences remain WordPress's responsibility.

## Existing plugins

The catalogue contains verified public release assets, including migrated and legacy plugins. Its update-management status identifies each installed plugin. For reviewed legacy updater files, exact SHA-256 matches allow narrowly scoped updater callbacks to be suspended while the controller runs. Unknown file versions remain flagged for review. Deactivating this controller can allow unchanged legacy updater code to resume; migrated client plugins never run a fallback updater.

A complete migration still requires a new release of each feature plugin removing its updater hooks, cron jobs and forced-refresh code, and adding the [client integration](docs/CLIENT-API.md). Site-level MU plugins and custom forced-refresh redirects require separate inspection. Plugin settings are not removed by controller deactivation/deletion. Controller state is retained for recovery.

## Release catalogue publishing

The publisher remains for controller versions through 0.6.x and release audits: run `python3 scripts/publish-catalogue.py`, then commit/push verified `catalogue.json`. `--check` validates without writing. Controllers 0.7.0+ discover new releases directly on an explicit check and do not depend on this publication. No scheduled publishing scans are configured.

## Build and recovery

Run `bash scripts/build-plugin-zip.sh`. The root ZIP and `dist/tn-update-controller.zip` contain only the plugin directory. Commit the root ZIP, tag matching header/changelog/readme versions, upload the ZIP to the GitHub release, then run the catalogue publisher. Each controller has a separate release. For recovery use the verified official release ZIP via WordPress Upload Plugin or trusted hosting deployment tools.

The integration helper is source for feature-plugin migrations, not part of the installed controller ZIP. It resolves the official controller ZIP only after an authorised install action. No WordPress.org listing is assumed; readme Contributors is intentionally blank pending a confirmed WordPress.org username.

See [validation](docs/VALIDATION.md) for tested behaviour and limits. See [standards](https://github.com/cchatterton/codex-standards).

## Catalogue readiness

See [beta classification and catalogue grouping](docs/BETA-CATALOGUE.md). Set `beta` explicitly for every registry entry. Approved readiness changes are included in verified catalogue metadata.
