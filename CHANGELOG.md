## 0.4.2 - 2026-09-26

- Add Installed between Active and Available; keep beta installed plugins in Installed and retain their chip.
- Active cards offer Deactivate; Installed cards offer Activate and Delete; uninstalled Available/Beta cards offer Install. Updates remain on Updates available.

- Keep active beta plugins in Active and show a Beta chip in cards and the installed list.

- Mark the ten migrated Techn plugins non-beta; all other Techn entries and all AlphaSys entries except the migrated AS Local CSS remain beta until reviewed against the new standards.
- Keep search working across groups and hide sections with no matching cards.
- Preserve PHP 7.4 compatibility and existing installation/update behaviour.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-09-26
