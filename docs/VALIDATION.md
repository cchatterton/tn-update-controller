# Validation — 0.1.0

Run on 26 September 2026 in an isolated local WordPress 7.1.2 installation with both controllers, PHP 8.5.7 and MySQL 8.0.35. All packaged PHP also passes PHP 8.1.29 syntax checks.

## Executed checks

- Cold, warm and failed caches: repeated native update-transient reads, View details and all six controller screens made zero update-metadata HTTP calls.
- One aggregate HTTP request per brand check; cooldown, atomic lock, independent brand state, 429 / Retry-After backoff, malformed metadata and last-good cache retention.
- Strict author/repository identity, duplicate IDs, third-party provider preservation, unauthorised install/check rejection.
- Native official release ZIP installation and old-to-current updates for Menubot and AS QS Relay; checksum and root/version verification; newly installed plugins remain inactive; update preserves activation and an existing settings option.
- Tampered package and unexpected archive root rejection; PHP/dependency requirements; disabled file modifications; partial-batch results and safe interrupted-request recovery.
- Audited legacy hooks removed for Menubot and AS QS Relay; active client/controller metadata produces one GitHub link and one controller check link.
- Absent/inactive controller bootstrap: correct Install/Activate actions, repeated helper inclusion without duplicate handlers, and zero HTTP.
- Multisite: network-scoped state and locks, main-site-only scheduling, no subsite schedule duplication, subsite-admin install denial and rejection of a merely site-active controller as a network provider.
- Both controllers updated themselves from their live published GitHub ZIPs on the disposable multisite, preserving network activation and saved controller state. Live published catalogues include the controller itself.
- Browser: desktop cards, 390-pixel layout, live catalogue search, manual-mode settings save, and independent AlphaSys catalogue.

## Reproduction

Use a disposable installation with both source repositories linked into wp-content/plugins and both controllers active. These tests intentionally change test options and install official plugin assets. Never run them on a live customer site.

```sh
wp eval-file tests/integration.php
wp eval-file tests/install.php
wp eval-file tests/security.php
# On a disposable multisite with both controllers network-active and blog ID 2:
wp eval-file tests/multisite.php
```

Tests use the adjacent repository catalogue fixtures. `install.php` requires outbound access to the public GitHub release assets. The publisher independently verifies every catalogue ZIP before publication.

## Limits

WordPress 6.5 is the declared minimum; full runtime tests used WordPress 7.1.2. PHP 8.1 was syntax-checked. Feature behaviour of all catalogue plugins, every historical legacy updater version, hosting credential-based filesystem transports, host-specific MU code and every possible feature-plugin activation scope were not exhaustively exercised. The guided installer supports direct filesystem writes; native WordPress flows remain the recovery route on credential-based filesystems. The controller is not a backup or rollback service.

Initial feature-plugin catalogue releases still use legacy integration. Their migration status is explicit. Reviewed hashes apply only to the exact inspected updater files. A future plugin release that changes those files needs migration to the client API or a new audited controller registry release. No customer site was changed during these tests.

## 0.1.1 — ten-plugin migration batch

The candidate-package test upgraded all ten selected Techn plugins through the controller's native WordPress upgrader. It covered the actual published TN User Management 1.8 package and the latest previous releases of the other nine, including QR Codes 1.5 (no published 1.4 package was found). One aggregate lookup served all ten, repeated legacy reads added zero metadata requests, each stored test setting survived, activation scope was preserved and all target headers reported Techn Controller API 1.

All ten migrated clients were also loaded together with the controller absent, installed-inactive and network-active. The shared helper registered once, each row had one GitHub and one correct controller action, and unauthorised users had no install/activate/check action. Persona26 integration, 55 Content Planner feature assertions on single-site WordPress and eight standalone WP Migrate suites passed. A native browser check showed consistent By Techn / GitHub / Check for updates links without Visit plugin site. The Environments save/redirect flow was corrected to run before admin output and verified in the browser.

The migration releases require WordPress 7.0+ and PHP 8.5+. Runtime testing used WordPress 7.1.2/PHP 8.5.7. No customer-site deployment has been performed.

The browser-driven **published** release run also completed ten of ten. It preserved network activation timestamps, site-only Menubot activation, inactive QR Codes state, and saved palette/content-plan/Persona26/environment settings. Repeated post-migration metadata reads remained HTTP-free. See [the release report](TEN-PLUGIN-MIGRATION.md).

## PHP 7.4 correction

See [PHP compatibility validation](PHP-COMPATIBILITY.md) for WordPress 7.0 runtime testing on PHP 7.4.30, 8.1.23 and 8.5.7. This supersedes the earlier PHP minimum and syntax-only compatibility notes above.

## Interface 0.2.0

See [interface validation](INTERFACE-0.2.0.md) for modal checking, bulk progress, failure and interruption recovery, catalogue installation and PHP 7.4 rendering checks.
